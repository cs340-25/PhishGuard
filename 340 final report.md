PhishGuard was created to help keep people safe online by identifying phishing emails. While some email services like google already have built in spam detection we wanted to make it possible to easily get a second opinion on if the email seems safe or suspicious. Our approach was to create a machine learning model that returns true \- the message is suspicious \- or false \- the message is safe. We decided to create a website that would allow users to submit the email in question to receive a response from our model. We originally intended for our project to be some form of cross platform plugin compatible with multiple email services, but time constraints limited us to only integrating with Gmail. Originally our machine learning model was going to use logistic regression but we ended up changing to a random forest model as we were seeing better results from that. We also ended up having major changes in the development of our project at the last minute. On Monday May 5th we got an email about our oracle cloud instance which was hosting our database. This email informed us that our instance was terminated and all data was deleted and non-recoverable. Before this we had a fully working product that could store all our user information and the results from the model. Without the database our backend no longer had anything to connect to and couldn’t store the data. We were able to put together a quick solution using a Postgres DB hosted on Render, but the database is almost completely empty. With this project we had met our goals, creating a machine learning model that could be easily used to determine if a message was phishing or not. While the database being deleted was unfortunate timing we are still happy with the results of our project and feel that we met all of our goals.

There have been no changes for our customer value.

Our project used several different technologies. First our actual model was made possible using Python. We used a RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn to train and saved our model. We tested the model using a confusion matrix and five fold cross-evaluation and achieved good results. Once we were done training and testing the model we made a Python app that used flask to host an endpoint to hit for predictions from the model. We then used React and Node.js to handle our front end. This allowed us to create a custom login page for our users, where they could submit new emails to be checked or view previous results. Another part of our project was the backend using java with spring boot framework. The backend connected our database and front end together which allowed us to keep track of users and the results from the model. The frontend communicates with the spring boot endpoints on the backend to do things such as create users, login, and store/retrieve data. We set up our database manually on an oracle cloud server, this allowed us to create the tables we needed and have 24/7 access to our database. The database has a table for our users and a table to store all of the predictions from the model so users can see the results of their previous uses. This database worked well for us allowing us to keep track of our users and allow them to retrieve the results from previous emails they tested. Each endpoint for the backend was individually tested using insomnia and then was tested through our react frontend. **![][image1]**Model Results

Team roles were mostly static, but everyone was willing to help where they were needed. Zebulon was in charge of the front end development and led the efforts to get that working. Tyler was in charge of the spring boot backend and worked on setting up the database. Trevor took charge in the development of the model and also worked on getting the database set up. ​​Sarvvesh did a little bit of each part, he worked with whoever needed the most help at the time and helped make sure we didn’t fall behind. Everyone worked together well and contributed in the way they were most useful. 

For the most part we succeeded in completing our goals. We have a complete and working model with a test accuracy of 99%. While our real world accuracy probably won’t end up being this high it is a good start and we are happy with how the model performs. Our website is also user friendly and easy to use even for people who aren’t good with technology. This is important to us because the people most likely to fall victim to phishing attacks often don’t have a strong technology background. We wanted our product to be easily accessible and usable to make it convenient for our users, which we have felt successful in doing. The primary shortfall is the lack of compatibility with email services other than Google, but we have made a temporary solution to this by adding a manual form submission so anyone can copy and paste the information in and get a response.

Overall we feel this project was a success, our team had good communication and teamwork which helped a lot in completing this project. Due to our ability to effectively communicate with each other we were able to employ code reviews which allowed our code to be at a higher quality and also made it so all our members could understand what was happening in each part of the project. We also did pair programming throughout the project. This also allowed us to make sure we were all on the same page for the next steps in the project. Good communication was able to improve our planning abilities and even help development go smoother. The development of Java and React went the most smoothly as our members had previous experience with that. There were some difficulties with the creation of the model but we were eventually able to figure it out. The database is where we had the most issues and was the least successful part of this project. While the database was unsuccessful we were still able to learn from it. In the future we would use a different service rather than an oracle cloud instance with a database we set up ourselves. We would also look into creating backups in case something similar were to happen. Even with the difficulties we experienced our team grew as a whole. We learned more about what it is like to work in a software development project and different technologies that we had never used before. Due to these reasons and the fact our phishing detection model works as we intended our group considers the final project a success.
